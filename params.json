{"name":"Location-service","tagline":"A sensor location data collection for Android","body":"# Welcome to the Location-Service project\r\n\r\n![devicelook](https://raw.github.com/camliu89/Location-Service/master/images/devicelook.png)\r\n\r\nThe project is dedicated for research purpose. If you want to be involved in the project, please contact the main developer. The contact information is located below this page.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis Android app is exclusively used for research purpose. The project was created as a research for a class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The main use of this app is to track the location of the users in an interval of time.\r\n\r\n## Problems\r\n\r\nCurrently, the apps sample data every 10 minutes. This will kill the phone in less than 5 hours. One problem of the app, and for the majority of apps out there using sensors, is the energy spent. One major upgrade of this app is to come up with a energy saving algorithm for the Android platform. \r\n\r\nAnother problem is cycle of life of the Android app. Currently, Android OS will kill any non-important app if the memory of the phone is running low. This app is considered not important; therefore killing the app and stop sampling location data without informing the users. \r\n\r\nNew ideas are welcome!\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\n* [User Guide](https://github.com/camliu89/Location-Service/wiki/User-Guide)\r\n* [Developer Guide] (https://github.com/camliu89/Location-Service/wiki/Developer-Guide)\r\n* [Contact Us] (https://github.com/camliu89/Location-Service/wiki/Contact-Us)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
